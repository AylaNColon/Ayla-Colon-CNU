Today I will be rewviewing, [9 Latin Neighborhoods you can Explore in Street View!](https://artsandculture.google.com/story/rwLSW7I0DlcAJA) is a Digital Humanities project by Google Arts and Culture and Hollie Jones. This project provides a very interesting way to learn about latino culture in the United States. It is set up as a slide show that has arrows that direct you down and shows a picture of the street from Google as well as a brief description of the neighborhood. This project is great for anyone who is latino or not latino to look to learn more about the culture or even where to go to experience these cultures.

The project starts with a neighborhood in Ybor City in Florida where it was formerly known as the “Cigar Capital of the World''. Since it was known for this, it makes sense that this neighborhood is mainly latinos from Cuba. Another City in Florida called Calle Ocho was featured in this DH project where many Cubans live, this city is also known as little Havana.

Some of the other neighborhoods mentioned are El pueblo De los Angeles in California, Pilsen in Illinois, El Segundo Barrio and San Antonio both in Texas. The commonality between these four neighborhoods is that they are all heavily populated by Mexicans. El Pueblo De los Angeles is known for the Mexican marketplace, Pilsen is known for the colorful murals, El segundo Barrio is one of the oldest neighborhoods in El Paso Texas, and San Antnio is known for popularizing the breakfast taco. 

The other three neighborhoods are Washington Heights in New York which is Dominican based, Mount Pleasant in Washington D.C. which is El Salvadorian based, and Puerto Rico which is a U.S. Territory. Washington Heights is known for bodegas which are latino corner stores and it is the birthplace of the Dominican Day parade. Mount Pleasant is known for all the pupuserias and San Juan is known for being a U.S. Territory in the Caribbean. 

This project has a lot of potential to educate many people on where latino neighborhoods are located and what they represent. There are a few things I would have liked to see be different in this project, the first being more diversity. There are four out of nine neighborhoods that talk about Mexican neighborhoods, I am sure there are many other latin cultures that populate other neighborhoods. 

Another thing I would have tweaked would be that San Juan although is a part of the U.S. should not have been in this Digital Humanities project. It is a country that happens to be a part of the United States. To say it is a neighborhood is not giving it full credit for who they are and what they have gone through over the years.

As for the actual structure of the project I would have liked to have been able to actually explore the neighborhoods at street view, not just a picture of it from google. This is a misconception I had as the title said “Street View ''. Another issue I had was for the first neighborhood, Ybor City, the street view picture does not show up. I would suggest to the creator of this project to double check and make sure all the pictures are visible to viewers on all platforms.

Overall this project was super insightful, as a latina I was aware of some of these neighborhoods but not all. It was super interesting to learn more about other latin cultures and where I could go to experience them here in the United States. Although I know there are more cultures here in the states I think this project did a good job in highlighting some of the important ones.
