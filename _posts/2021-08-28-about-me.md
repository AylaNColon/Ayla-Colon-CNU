My name is Ayla Colon, I am a Junior at **Christopher Newport University** Majoring in Business marketing and minoring in Communications. Once I graduate I plan on pursuing a career in the marketing field, however I am not one hundred percent sure where that will be. I hope to stay close to home to be near my family.

My family is a major part of my life. I am the oldest of four, I have a thirteen year old sister, a ten year old sister, and an eight year old brother. I also have two older step-brothers as well who no longer live at home. My family is very active, my parents coach sports for all my siblings so we are constantly running around.

Besides spending time with my family I enjoy spending time with my friends and sorority sisters here on campus. I am a part of 3 different organizations on campus, Latino Student Association, Medical Fitness Association, and Alpha Sigma Alpha. 

The Latino Student Association has brought me so many friends and connections, it has been my home away from home. We hold so many events on campus, one of my favorites was the senior send off last semester. We held a cookout which we refer to as a _Carne Asada_. I also hold an E-board position which is Public Relations.

Through LSA I have also joined the Medical Fitness Association where I am the Public Relations officer as well. We are the first student chapter and I helped found it as well. We do tons of workouts and encourage people to use exercise instead of medication.

My sorority, Alpha Sigma Alpha, has brought me so many friends and connections. For example my first internship this past summer was because of my sorority sisterâ€™s dad. We do tons of charity work and community service which is another huge passion of mine. Having this sisterhood has been a big part of my college experience.

During my internship I had the opportunity to work for a telecommunications company called NTT DATA where I got to help oversee the renovations of their new facility. This was a great experience and was given another opportunity to work with them again next summer. Even though this was not in the marketing field It was still beneficial to get real world work experience and taught me many skills.
