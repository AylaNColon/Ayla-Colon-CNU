# My Thinglink #

The map I created follows the storyline of how I became involved on campus. It starts off my freshman year in my freshman dorm and how those people kickstarted my journey here at Christopher Newport University. If it were not for them I would not be as involved as I am today. While creating this map I constantly thought about how my life at CNU would be different if I did not meet the people I met, and how I might not be in the organizations I am today.

The way my Thinglink map works is there are two paths you can follow. It starts off with a green number one then you can pick which path you want to follow first, one is how I got involved with Alpha Kappa Psi. The other version is how I join Alpha Sigma Alpha and the journey with other people.

During the brainstorm process I quickly came up with this idea to use the people and the locations I met them to tell the story of my involvement over the years. I think people are a big part of one’s college experience. Making friends is the key to getting involved and to making a university feel like home. 

The two organizations that make me feel at home at CNU are Alpha Sigma Alpha and Latino Student Association. LSA made me feel connected to my hispanic culture and allowed me to make connections with other hispanic students on campus. ASA gave me my sisterhood where I feel like I have family on campus, people I can count on no matter what. 

My freshman year I really struggled with getting involved and loving the campus life. I felt very excluded and noticed I was always in my room or constantly with my roommates. I found myself going home a lot over the weekends or calling my family and telling them I wanted to be at home. 

COVID really messed up a lot of people’s lives when it came to college life, it prevented people from being able to get involved with other students and organizations. However, for me it did the opposite. I found myself even more involved and connected with my friends. Over the pandemic and lock down I decided to join my sorority,Alpha Sigma Alpha, and become an office within the Medical Fitness Association.

Comparing my freshman year self to now I am so proud of how much I have grown and how I now love CNU. I am now a part of four organizations and hold office positions in two of them. Whenever people ask me how I like my school I am always honest with them, I tell them at first I hated it here but now I love it because I have my people. I have a group of friends who make CNU feel like home. 

While creating my Thinglink I really enjoyed walking down memory lane and looking at all my pictures and videos. I think the concept of an interactive map with memories is super personal and gives a good glimpse into my life.
