# Review 

Today I will be reviewing a Digital Humanities project, The Shape of History. This project is about Elizabeth Palmer Pebody and her discoveries on visualization. The goal for this DH project was to show a different approach to visualization, specifically a little more abstract. It dives into the system Elizabeth discovered, which is a method that shows historical events through shapes and colors. This is shown through many different examples and hands on and allows the reader to fully understand this different approach and visualize and interpret the image themselves.

The structure of this project was super thought out, the layout of the website is identical to the layout of the method Elizabeth discovered. The only issue with this is that it can get a little confusing at a first glance. The arrows to point you in the right direction are a little small and you have to understand the concept behind the method before you fully understand the layout of the project. Another issue with the layout of this website is that you have to use google chrome to access it, it is not compatible with safari. The website should be accessible to anyone no matter what browser they use.

The explore page wasn’t much help either. There are no real instructions on how to navigate it. It is just a grid with colors and the dates next to it. It is confusing because it gives no context as to what those dates are significant for. The only way to understand it is to investigate the page further and to look some of them up. The learn page was confusing as well, it would be more helpful if the website provided more context as to how this grid worked. It would be beneficial to have directions on each page so the user can understand the activity they are working on. 

The game itself was also slightly confusing. It shows how it works through the events of Elizabeth and her lifetime but when it comes to creating your own events I was confused as to how it actually worked and what I was supposed to be accomplishing. Although the idea is really interesting, it just seems like the creator of this did not fully explain how to do it properly. 

The last section of the project was the compare page, in all honesty this page was the most confusing. I was completely lost on what exactly I was comparing. All it said was to “mouse over any events to compare representation.” Once again I think there should be more explanation throughout the entire project.

Another issue with the project was that not all the linked websites did not work, 2 out of the 7 links in the Further Reading section. When a project is published the author should make sure that all links work properly. Even if the link may be outdated it should still be constantly updated so that the reader has all the current information on the project. This is especially important in this section because a person like me who would like to know more about this project and Elizabeth Pebody would not be able to do so because the links used no longer work. 

Overall this project was very detail oriented and well thought out when it came to the layout of it. It was mostly lacking direction and some explanation for users who are unfamiliar with this format of showing historical events. I really enjoyed learning about this new technique for visualizing events with a grid, I had never heard of this before this DH project.
